<h1>You Need to Contact Me?  Why?</h1>

<p>So I've found that getting into contact me largely depends on where I am spatially located in relation to you.  This seems to have worked for the most part in life.  As such, make your choice accordingly.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>If I'm near you (same room/building):</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If I'm near you, say hi.  I normally respond back.  Usually.  Maybe do something outlandish to get my attention, if it's that important.</li>
				<li>If I'm not near you, yell loudly.  I might hear you and yell back.</li>
				<li>Do you have a flashlight?  No?  Sounds like your problem then.</li>
				<li>Do you know magic?  Are you a wizard?  Well why not?  I've always wanted to meet one.</li>
			</ul>

		<li><h3>If I'm not near you:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Have we exchanged phone numbers?  You can call me with your cell phone.  In the future, we will have phones implanted into our brains called braincells, can you contact me through fancy mental telepathy.  Yes, the person who first started calling these devices "braincells" was dealt with in a brutal fashion for making such a cringeworthy pun.</li>
				<li>If I don't answer, I NEED HELP.  SEND HELP.  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR</li>
			</ul>

		<li><h3>To contact me through THE INTERNET:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I can be reached at <a href="mailto:robert.snodgrass@gmail.com"> Gmail</a>.</li>
				<li>My Github account should be at <a href="https://github.com/RobertSnodgrass"> located here</a> but I'm worried I'm not linking it correctly.</li>	
				
			</ul>
	</ul>
