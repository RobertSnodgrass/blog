<h1>Blog Posts</h1>

<h1 id="blog2">Saturday, Septerber 14th, 2014</h1>
	<h4>Morning</h4>
		<p class="tbb">The sun rises.  Well I couldn't really tell, actually, because there were a lot of clouds.  I guess weathermen...weatherindividuals....the people on TV talking about weather are right some of the time.  It's really gray out there, soft droplets falling to the earth, little songs each dying in the distance and on the concrete.</p>
	<h4>Afternoon</h4>
		<p class="tbb">General malaise.  And I'm out of mayonnaise.  Which is good - I hate the stuff.  So since I never buy it, I guess I'm <em>always</em> out of it.  Problem solved.</p>
	<h4>Is that really Saul in that episode of Arrested Development?</h4>
		<p class="tbb">Trying to work on my project for MakerSquare.  I'm supposed to be writing some blog posts, but I have no idea how long they are supposed to be.  There's rain outside, gray and misty, and I'm trying to remember if I left my car windows down.  It's going to be bad if I did.  <br><br>
	 	My attempt at doing indentation isn't turning out quite what I had wanted; I'll have to remmeber to fix that later.  I'm assuming if I come right out and say this in the blog itself, the instructors won't hold it against me.</p>

<h1 id="blog3">Sunday, September 15th, 2014</h1>
	<p>My car windows were up.  So that's good.  <br><br>
	I'm still not too clear on the length of a blog post, but I'm assuming the idea behind the homework was simply to demonstrate building an exceedingly simple webpage, and then using Git commands properly to upload the files.  I could always e-mail the professors I suppose, but it's the weekend.  I can always get clarification tomorrow in class.  <br><br>Am I supposed to be writing these blog posts on another page?  Maybe I'll make one just as a backup.  <br><br>It's gray out today.<br><br>Why do I keep mispelling September? It's fixed now, but I did it twice in a row.</p>

<h1 id="blog4">Monday, September 16th, 2014</h1>
	<p>So now I'm pretty worried about not writing the correct material in the blog posts.  People in the class are on Facebook talking about it currently, and I found out that I might be the only one writing gibberish.  I might also be the only person who is writing a single "blog" page instead of spacing every entry out on separate pages.  But I'm kind of committed to it now (git it?) since class is all of five hours away, so I'm going to roll with these decisions and take the brutal repurcussions they might birth. <br><br>
	It's dark in here.  In my head, I mean.  I imagine I'll have to go back and re-write all of these posts later on, in an honest attempt to look like I might actually have an idea of what I'm doing.</p>

<h1 class="blog1">Links to other parts of my obvoiusly great blog</h1>

		<li><p>Want to go back to my awesome "About Me" page?  No?  Well too bad,  here's a <a href="index.html"> link anyway, jerk</a>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Need to contact me?  I mean I don't know why you would, but here's a <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p></li>
