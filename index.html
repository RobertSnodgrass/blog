	<h1>Bob's blog</h1>
	<img class ="test" src="in-me-own-words-bigfoot.jpg" />
	<p>I currently work as a technical support writer at a medical records company based in Austin, TX.  I am a 2005 graduate of Texas A&M with a degree in English.  I enjoy running long distance (training for a marathon), doing cross-fit, and sketching.  I'm currently attending MakerSquare's Front End coursework, and hope to also take the full time course to facilitate a career switch into web and mobile development.  I'm a little too nervous most of the time.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I grew up in Bryan/College Station.</li>
		<li>My best friend lives in Japan.</li>
		<li>I have three sisters and one half brother.</li>
		<li>This list isn't very interesting, I know.</li>
	</ul>
